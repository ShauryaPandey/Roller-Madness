# Roller-Madness
Unity 3D game

# Description:
This Unity based game has 2 levels, the userâ€™s mission in both the levels will be to maneuver a silvery ball to collect a certain number of coins, at the same time avoiding contact with the brown enemy boxes that have been programmed to chase the user wherever they go.
The key concepts I gathered from this project were randomly spawning of objects and switching between multiple Unity scenes.

# Prerequisites:
You must be having firefox. If not then to run on other browsers you should have a http server to run the application, which is a webGL build.

# Installing:
Pull the repository to your local machine. If you have firefox run index.html on it. If you dont have firefox, use a web server like mongoose.

# Failing to run on firefox:
In case you get an error dialog which says, : "It seems your browser does not support running Unity WebGL content from file:// urls. Please upload it to an http server, or try a different browser"
then, change "privacy.file_unique_origin" to "false" in about:config

# Built with:
Unity
